## Add extra firmware (kali-linux-headless depends on firmware we wants, but
## some can't be put there because they require network access... but we
## install those in the live image anyway since we have network access
## when we build the live ISO).

## Make sure we install as many input/video drivers as we can. Note that
## these packages need to be explicitly listed if we want to be sure that
## they're installed. Installing xserver-xorg is not enough to make sure,
## due to its dependencies, defined as such:
##  * xserver-xorg-input-all | xorg-driver-input
##  * xserver-xorg-video-all | xorg-driver-video
##
xserver-xorg-input-all
xserver-xorg-video-all
